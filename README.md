 # Cotton Trend and Price Prediction
 
 # First Evaluation
 In the first evaluation we have predicted price and trend using three models i.e LSTM, Ada Booster, XGB Booster
 
 ## XGB Booster & Ada Booster Regressors
   Code and Notebooks for these models are present in **"Cotton Linear Model Price Prediction"** Folder and dataset used for this is **MyDataset.csv** 

## LSTM model
   Code and Notebooks for these models are present in **"Trend Prediction"** Folder and dataset used for this is **cotton-prices-historical-chart-data.csv**,
In this notebook we are applying Deep Learning model RNN - LSTM to find the trends in the cotton prices and predict the price based on that trend

## Web App Design
   For Web App we started with designing the web app in figma link for prototype is:
